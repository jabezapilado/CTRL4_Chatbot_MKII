# SOC Guidance Office Chatbot — Frontend
Holy Angel University | School of Computing
Development of an AI-Powered Chatbot for Inquiry Management Using NLP-Based Negative Emotion Detection

## Current State

- The frontend is now wired to the Flask backend in this workspace.
- `login.html` routes `student` to the chatbot page and `staff` / `admin` to the dashboard.
- `dashboard.js` consumes backend inquiry, appointment, settings, and account endpoints.
- `chat.js` sends messages to the live `/chat` route.
- `chat_admin.js` still keeps some takeover/session state in the browser for now.
- Chat responses are now grounded by the backend multilingual RAG service.
- The backend also runs NLP-based negative emotion detection and may escalate counselor support immediately.

## Prototype Login

Use school-issued accounts, or configure local seed accounts through backend `.env` values.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 with custom properties, flexbox, grid, and responsive layouts
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flask backend serving the templates and static assets

## Page Overview

### 1. `appointment.html` - Student Appointment Booking
- Request form for guidance counseling appointments
- Validation and success modal feedback
- Holy Angel University branding

### 2. `chatbot.html` - Student Chat Interface
- Brand-themed chat window
- Quick reply buttons for common inquiries
- Typing indicator animation
- Emotion badge per bot response
- Escalation notice when a message is flagged

### 3. `dashboard.html` - Staff/Admin Dashboard
- Sidebar navigation and summary cards
- Filterable inquiry and appointment lists
- Backend-driven status updates and notes
- Mobile-responsive collapsible sidebar

### 4. `login.html` - Login Page
- Account-based login for student, staff, and admin accounts
- Email and password fields with validation states
- Backend login call to `/auth/login`

## How to Run

1. Make sure the backend is already set up and running.
2. Open the Flask app in your browser.
3. Use the pages below depending on what you want to test.

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```

The frontend is served by Flask, so you do not open the HTML files directly.

Useful pages:

- `/` or `/login` for login
- `/chatbot` for student chat
- `/dashboard` for staff/admin view

## Backend Contract

- Chat messages go to `/chat`.
- Authentication goes to `/auth/login`.
- Dashboard data comes from `/api/inquiries`, `/api/escalations`, `/api/appointments`, `/api/accounts`, and `/api/settings`.
- The backend returns JSON responses that the frontend renders directly.

## AI Integration Note

- The frontend does not read from the top-level `ai/` folder.
- The active chatbot behavior comes from backend RAG components (`backend/server/service.py`, `backend/knowledge_base/`, and `backend/data/rag_index/`).
- The top-level `ai/` folder is retained as legacy archive only.

## Color Theme
| Name | Hex | Use |
|------|-----|-----|
| Maroon | `#7B1113` | Primary brand color |
| Maroon Dark | `#5A0C0E` | Header gradient, hover states |
| Gold | `#C9A84C` | Accents, borders |
| Gold Light | `#E8C97A` | Highlights on dark backgrounds |

## Notes

- This frontend is designed to live inside the Flask project root.
- Staff and admin currently share the same dashboard page.
- The admin helper page still keeps some browser-side takeover state until that flow is fully backend-backed.
